**Project Title**
My project is named planner app(very creative i know!). It is a GUI application for a planner.

**Description**
The main purpose of this app is to help user plan with features like creating To-Do lists and Journal. It includes a marvel themed daily quotes section, a to-do list section that 
the user can add, remove, and mark tasks as complete, a calendar(Date) section that displays the current date, and finally a 'how do i feel?' journaling section.
